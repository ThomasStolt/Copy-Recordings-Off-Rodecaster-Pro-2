# Copy-Recordings-Off-Rodecaster-Pro-2

Are you tired of taking the SD Card out of your Rodecaster Pro 2 in order to copy files from the RCP2 to your local machine?
Are you tired of using RODE Central to copy your recordings nad waiting for hours on end? Despite the promises of the high speed on it?

Here is the solution to all of your problems! :)

This extremely complex framework and highly sophisticated framework applies modern AI and ML techniques, uses Large Language Model frameworks and other leading edge technologies to allow you to copy files from your Rodecaster Pro 2 to your local machine, using rsync. This is born out of leading edge technology research, used by NASA, literally all 3-letter agencies - it is so complex, please just stop trying to understand it. Perhaps the Borg in the future will begin to understand that, but it would probably cost them about 5 Trillion Yottabytes. Who knows!

So, in order to use this, to the following:

- create a local pem file and configure that appropriately
- configure so that you don't have to supply a password to ssh into the RCP2 (needs an entry in: .ssh/config)
- configure the rsync binary provided in the repository to your RCP2
- the use the provided script to rsync the files

And you are done.

Awesome! Again, stop trying to understand it. When I asked ChatGPT, it broke down and took half the internet with it. So, give up!

Yes. Just give up!
